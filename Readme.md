## Not working on Debian 10 (see details in wiki)

## Description
CustomPOS is a retail Point of sale system based on LibreOffice and written with macro you can customize easily. Don't think it is a simple spreadsheet file, it has network multi-user capabilities and use proven database engine. Reduced typing needs interface allow great efficiency like in POS module made of one page only where invoices are recorded after one popup.


CustomPOS main concepts:
- You can customize this program easily with basic programing skill. Some module has to be rewritten to fit yours needs, then you will appreciate full control over your software.

 Yes, it is dangerous and it's the open door to mistakes that will be detected by the following modules:
* Invoice check module compare invoice's details with invoice's header and list every incoherencies
* Stock check module calculate for each item the theoretical quantity and the gap with current stock by compiling every input and output

## Planned features
* A single user simple to install version will be available later but you can install the client-server version for immediate use.
* Localized versions
* Sales statistics

## Advancement
Only Linux-French version is currently available.
Item edit page is not planned anymore, direct database edit has not caused me any trouble till now, but you have to be very carefull.
Only main features are currently available. Statistics have to be done externaly. Stability is good without being as good as other classic programs, but don't worry, data loss cannot happen with transactional request. Last version is the 0.7. See changelog in Wiki section for versions notes.

## Limitations
Despite CustomPOS's capability to handle many users, it is not recommended for big companies. You have to deal with LibreOffice powerful features that cannot all be locked so that advanced users can hack it.

* Max number of invoice: 18446744073709551615 BIGINT(20)
* Max number of sold item: 18446744073709551615 BIGINT(20)  (can be reseted after invoices archiving)
* Max number of item per invoice: 100 (limited by mysql connector)
* Number of reference per item: 6 (can be extended)

Demo version can only manage one user at a time due to the limitation of used database (HSQLDB)
