## Planned features
* A simple install single user version will be available later but you can install the client-server version for immediate use.

* Sales statistics

## Advancement
Only Linux-French version is currently available.
An item edit page was planned but direct database edit is so practicle that item module is canceled.
Only main features are currently available. Statistics have to be done externaly. Stability is good without being as good as other classic programs, but don't worry, data loss cannot happen with transactional request. Last version is the 0.7. See changelog in Wiki section for versions notes.

## Limitations
Despite CustomPOS's capability to handle many users, it is not recommended for big companies. You have to consider that LibreOffice powerful features cannot all be locked and can be hacked by dvanced users.

* Max number of sold item: 18446744073709551615 BIGINT(20)  (can be reseted after invoices archiving)
* Max number of item per invoice: 100 (limited by mysql connector)
* Number of reference per item: 6 (can be extended)

Demo version can only manage one user at a time due to the different type of database (HSQLDB) it use.
