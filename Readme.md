## Description
CustomPOS is a retail Point of sale system programed with macro so that you can customize it easily. Don't think it is a simple spreadsheet file, CostomPOS has network multi-user capabilities by using proven database engine. The interface is designed to get the best efficiency with reduced typing needs, POS module is made of one page only where invoices are recorded after one popup validation only.

CustomPOS main concepts are:
- You can customize this program yourself. Some more work is needed to make your localised version but the benefit to have full control over your software is priceless, i.e it's free.  :)   Don't be affraid about the apparent program's complexity, it integrates advanced price management which you may not need and which can be removed.
- You are the master of your data: full database access let you correct any mistakes at their origin without living correcting records in database, you can also extract datas for statistic, accounting, etc ...

## Planned features
* A simple install demo version will be available soon. But you can install right now the client-server version and use it localy
* Localized versions

## Advancement
Only Linux-French version is currently available. The item edit page does not exist yet, but direct database edition works great if you have correctly granted users. Only main features are currently available. Statistics have to be done externaly. Stability is good without being as good as other classic programs, but don't worry, data loss cannot happen with transactional request. Last version is the 0.7. See changelog in Wiki section for versions notes.

## Limitations
Despite CustomPOS's capacity to handle many users, it is not recommended for big companies. You have to consider that LibreOffice has powerful features that cannot all be locked so that advanced users can hack it.

* Max number of invoice: 18446744073709551615 BIGINT(20)
* Max number of sold item: 18446744073709551615 BIGINT(20)  (can be reseted after invoices archiving)
* Max number of item per invoice: 100 (limited by mysql connector)
* Number of reference per item: 6 (can be extended)

Demo version can only manage one user at a time due to the different type of database (HSQLDB) it use.
